## üìã Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Matchmaking and Skill Levels

**Q: Is the matchmaking based on any kind of Elo or my skill?** \
A: Not at the moment, but we have plans to update our algorithm and implement a ranked system.

---

### Connection and Lag Issues

**Q: My opponent is lagging, is it the server's fault?** \
A: It's a combination of factors. Several elements can affect gameplay on Yuzu:
- The stability of your or your opponent's internet connection (Ethernet is **highly** recommended).
- The hardware specifications of your or your opponent's system (lower-end PCs may result in freezing or longer loading times during matches).
- The geographical distance between the server, your opponent, and yourself.

### Playing Outside of EU

**Q: I live outside of the EU, can I still play using JigglyConnect?** \
A: It's a bit tricky. We can't provide a definitive answer due to the multitude of factors involved. We currently do not recommend using our service extensively outside of the EU, but stay tuned as we plan to introduce more servers both inside and outside the EU in the near future.


### Additional Support

**Q: If my question is not addressed in the FAQ, where can I seek further assistance?** \
A: Feel free to ask us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XYWkknWBGS). Our community and support team are there to help you with any questions or concerns not covered in the FAQ.
