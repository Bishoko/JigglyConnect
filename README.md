## üìã Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Is the matchmaking based on any kind of elo or my skill ?
For now, no. We are planing to update our algorythme and do a ranked system. 

### My opponent is laging, is it the server's fault ? 
Yes and no. There are a lot of facters to keep in mind when playing on Yuzu:
- Your or your oppent connection and the stability of your internet (ethernet is recommended).
- Your hardware or your opponent  hardware (pcs that can't run the game proprely may result in freezing or loading time in match).
- The distance separing the server, your opponent and you.

### I live in outside of EU, can I still play using JigglyConnect ?
Uh... Kinda ? We can't really tell. As said earlier, there is so many factors. We don't recommand using our service yet (more servers inside and outside of EU will be available soon). But if you really want it, nothing can stop you...
